# sm64pcbuild
Ready-2-go, 60fps patched, new moves added. Presenting SM64 PC Port 60fps by yours truly.

Welcome to Super Mario 64 PC Port! We know that we builded with sm64pcBuilder 2 and we want to save your CPU while building the PC Port.

Main PLUS of this build is that:
• You don't need to download an emulator
• Don't need a SM64 ROM.
• Don't need a very fast high-end PC.

This build works for every computer with Windows only, very sorry Mac users.

Main MINUS of this build is that:
• You cannot perform a BLJ (Backwards Long Jump)

We will make a special build with no patches. No new moves, no 60fps patch, just pure original Mario 64 experience.

# How to play this game?

If you unpacked the zip file. Go to folder sm64-pc-port > build > us_pc > sm64.us.f3dex2e.exe
DO NOT delete any of the files for the game, basically you will ruin the game, and it wouldn't work.

# What do I need to install to play this game?

You need Visual C++ (2015-2019 recommended) and DirectX 11.

# How to control Mario?

Space - Pause/Resume
WSAD - Movement
K - Crouch/Prone
L - Jump
Comma Key (,) - Punch/Kick
Arrow Keys - Camera Movement
No key binded for changing camera modes.


# 120 Star save? Was that for testing purposes and not deleted?

We want for players to move around and explore Peach's Castle. Try out the new moves, and much more. It is basically just a "Test/Explore Save"

# When the Original Super Mario Experience build will come.

First we want the feedback from you guys, then we will compile an another version of SM64, this time original experience and original moves.

# THANK YOU FOR TRYING OUT SM64PCPORT!!!
